In regards to the dataset chosen.
The dataset used for this exercise was the records of total rainfall over the UK spanning months and years. The data was 
originally split into the year, the twelve months and the total rainfall over that year. The data spanned from 1836 to 2023.
The year was removed from the pool and the total rainfall was replaced by checking if it was within 150 of the average of 
UK rainfall and titled accordingly.

In regards to the use and purpose of the dataset.
Predicting whether the rainfall will be within the average of the year. This can have multiple uses for example catching trends
in which subsiquent years have had repeatedly higher than average rainfall or catching possible droughts early on in the year 
to prepare.

In regards to further exploration of the dataset.
The original analysis of the dataset was completed using Random forest. This, however, only gave an accuracy rating of 64.91%.
There is a possibility that this is simply due to the nature of the dataset itself as weather and therefore rainfalll are
nutoriously hard to predict.
